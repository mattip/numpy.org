      <description>Some information about the NumPy project and community
NumPy is an open source project aiming to enable numerical computing with Python. It was created in 2005, building on the early work of the Numerical and Numarray libraries. NumPy will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license.
NumPy is developed in the open on GitHub, through the consensus of the NumPy and wider scientific Python community.</description>

      <description>Array computing is the foundation of statistical, mathematical, scientific computing in various contemporary data science and analytics applications such as data visualization, digital signal processing, image processing, bioinformatics, machine learning, AI, and several others.
Large scale data manipulation and transformation depends on efficient, high-performance array computing. The language of choice for data analytics, machine learning, and productive numerical computing is Python.
Numerical Python or NumPy is its de-facto standard Python programming language library that supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and comes with a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.</description>

      <title>History of NumPy</title>
      <link>https://mattip.github.io/numpy.org/history/</link>

      <description>NumPy is a foundational Python library that provides array data structures and related fast numerical routines. When started, the library had little funding, and was written mainly by graduate students—many of them without computer science education, and often without a blessing of their advisors. To even imagine that a small group of “rogue” student programmers could upend the already well-established ecosystem of research software—backed by millions in funding and many hundreds of highly qualified engineers — was preposterous.</description>

      <description>The only prerequisite for NumPy is Python itself. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have Python yet and want the simplest way to get started, we recommend you use the Anaconda Distribution - it includes Python, NumPy, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.
NumPy can be installed with conda, with pip, or with a package manager on macOS and Linux. For more detailed instructions, consult our Python and NumPy installation guide below.</description>

      <guid>https://mattip.github.io/numpy.org/code-of-conduct/</guid>
      <description>Introduction This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the NumPy project, including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs, Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our community. The NumPy project does not organise in-person events, however events related to our community should have a code of conduct similar in spirit to this one.
This Code of Conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in the NumPy community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the project, in any project-related activities and especially when representing the project, in any role.</description>

      <description>This is the manual followed by NumPy’s Code of Conduct Committee. It’s used when we respond to an issue to make sure we’re consistent and fair.
Enforcing the Code of Conduct impacts our community today and for the future. It’s an action that we do not take lightly. When reviewing enforcement measures, the Code of Conduct Committee will keep the following values and guidelines in mind:
 Act in a personal manner rather than impersonal.</description>
